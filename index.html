            <h1>AnnoFlex</h1>
            <p>AnnoFlex is an annotation-based code generator for lexical scanners. It uses Java source code files and AnnoFlex-specific Javadoc tags as annotations in order to express lexical rules. Javadoc tags are used to circumvent double escaping in regular expressions as it occurs in Strings of common Java annotations. AnnoFlex is a fast code generator which creates fast lexical scanners. It provides a lot of sophisticated features, is easy to use and has several major advantages compared with classical code generators.</p>
            <h1>Features</h1>
            <p>Although AnnoFlex is a young tool, it provides a lot of functionalities. Of particular interest are the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>String and Reader input mode</li>
                <li>Large number of regular expressions</li>
                <li>Extensive code customization</li>
                <li>Very fast code generation</li>
                <li>Global and local macros</li>
                <li>Unicode character properties</li>
            </ul>
            <h1>Advantages</h1>
            <p>As AnnoFlex uses a Java source code file as the base format for the scanner definition it is possible to use all features of your favorite IDE for the entire code of your scanner - out of the box, without any plugins and without any restrictions. This especially includes, but is not limited to, the following features:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Syntax highlighting</li>
                <li>Refactoring</li>
                <li>Autocomplete</li>
                <li>Context information</li>
                <li>Reference information</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Developing a lexical scanner with AnnoFlex is easier and less time-consuming than with classical generators.
            The main reason for that is that the code of a scanner is not just a collection of plain-text snippets that are
            assembled by the code generator to a compilable class. Instead, the scanner is directly written in Java and only
            critical parts of the lexical analysis are added by the code generator. Because of this the code of an
            AnnoFlex-based scanner feels like real and modern code and not like unusable plain text. Try it out and feel the
            difference.</p>
